Hi, I'm @Tjetjetjenare or as most people call me, Max

When it comes to professional intrerests I'm most interested in data negineering and database management, but I also find data analysis and machine learning enjoyable and interesting. When I'm not coding, you can find me outside on the run track, on a bike or swimming as I like training a lot, but also a more quiet life with reading and drawing.
